# Tic-Tac-Toe

## What is Tic-Tac-Toe?

**Tic-Tac-Toe**, or **Noughts and Crosses** as it is called in _civilised_ countries, is a simple game wherein two players take turns marking a 3 x 3 grid with either X or O (depending on the player). Whoever achieves three X's or O's in a row first wins the game. 

## The Project

My rendition of the classic game is written in HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript. It features :

- Sound Effects
- A Pleasant Colour Scheme
- No Bugs (as far as I can see with my frankly extensive play-testing)
- WET Code
- Lots of console.logs
- Customisable Pop-Culture Icons because noughts and crosses are out-dated and the world doesn't have enough pop-culture references already
- Togglable Fully-Functional AI that is surprisingly hard to beat. I've yet to win a round against it.
- A score counter that keeps track of how many games each player has won.
- A reset button when you don't want to look at how many games you've lost to the AI
- Mobile functionality! You can play this on your phone

### I'm definitely not complaining here

I wasted a lot of time during this project. Most of that comes down to fiddling with the CSS styling, trying to get one part just right and breaking several other parts in the process. This starts a terrible loop where I'd go and fix what had broken, only then to break even more parts. I started experimenting with grid about halfway through when I'd finally gotten sick of my self-induced abuse, and found that it solved most, if not all my problems with CSS. If only I'd tried it out sooner.

Trying to refactor code too early, or pre-refactoring code before I had written it was also one of my downfalls. This process only works if I know exactly what to code and how exactly each moving part would feed into the next - but I definitely did not. I certainly felt that I knew what I was doing, but I was merely digging myself into bigger holes. I gave up that endeavor too, and progress certainly sped up if only at the cost of "dryness" and my sanity.

I also spent an ungodly amount of time trying to code the A.I. I feel more A than I at this point. **And it's _better_ at the game than I am**. 

Whilst I'm certainly happy and irrationally proud of what I have made, achieved and learnt while programming Tic-Tac-Toe, I did not achieve as much as I set out to do, leading to the

### List of planned features if I ever get around to finishing this project:

- Variable gameboard Sizes
- Two Dimensional Arrays for the gameBoard
- LocalStorage implementation
- Online Multiplayer (Genuinely have no concept of how this may ever work but if I read hard enough ~~and maybe plagiarise~~, I'm sure I can get it done)
- Better DRYer and refactored code
